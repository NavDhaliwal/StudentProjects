This code was to test if I can save social relationships in a database and use them 
to construct a graph and save the each node as memory pointer in the database.
Once a graph is constructed, it can be used to search any link.
This is supposed to be a web based application but unfortunately I lost
the front end code written in php which calls the c++ methods in a pc crash (Windows).
The database used was SQLite but final version should be in MySQl.
